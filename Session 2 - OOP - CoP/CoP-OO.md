# Concepts of Programming

## Object Oriented Programming

---

## Encapsulation

--

### Public/Private

Protect against Murphy (Accidents), not Machiavelli (Attacks).

* Pythons `__` (*double under*, *dunder* convention)
* Javascript `#` names
* Typesafe languages - it is still just memory

---

## Inheritance

--

### Single vs. Multiple inheritance

--

### Liskov Substitution Principle

A derived class (`D`)  can be substituted for its Base class (`B`) 
if it has all fields of `B` and the behavior is *identical*ยน

ยน *(without altering any of the desirable properties of the program)*{.fragment}

### Modeling the world

---

## Polymorphism

---

## Homework

* Go through [this tutorial](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/2980/practical-introduction-to-functional-programming-with-js) (i.e. Read and do the exercises) 
* (Bonus) A bit more explanation, but less practical: [So You Want to be a Functional Programmer](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/so-you-want-to-be-a-functional-programmer-part-1-1f15e387e536)
* (Bonus) If you want to jump into functional programming: [A List](https://purelyfunctional.tv/functional-programming-languages/) of viable languages
